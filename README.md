# stack-overflow-fanatic

## Usage

1. Clone this repo and use it to spin up a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) app.
1. In the Heroku dashboard, under app settings create two "Config Vars": `email` and `password`. These will be used to login to Stack Overflow.
1. Go to [WakeMyDyno](http://wakemydyno.com/) and enter the Heroku app URL (ex: http://stack-overflow-fanatic.herokuapp.com/). This will prevent your app from going to sleep due to inactivity between login sessions.
1. That's it!
